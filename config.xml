      There is a simple case for why end-to-end UI testing is impossible without automated image comparison. If youâ€™re not using a screenshot comparison tool, your product is at risk of shipping with visual bugs which rarely go unnoticed by users. Obviously, no sane QA engineer is willing to accept this risk.
